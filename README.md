Has Google Fixed It Yet? (HGFIY)
--------------------------------

This website tracks when Google Translate would fix the `zh-TW` translations. See it at

## Backend Setup

You will need to have Ruby installed and postgresql/sqlite3 library, then run `bundle` to install dependencies. You can
start both frontend and backend of the project by going to the `frontend` directory and run `yarn start`.

## Frontend Development

You can use work on the frontend locally with production data by running `yarn dev:prod` in the `frontend` directory.
