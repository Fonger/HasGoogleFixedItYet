## I want to add a new word to be tracked?

Please edit the `seed.rb` file and add your word and its corresponding Taiwanese (as in Traditional Chinese used in
Taiwan) translation to the end of the `WORDS` array. Please also make sure your addition have a trailing comma as well
as this would ensure we won't have a conflict between two PRs at the same time.

Make a pull request once we have the edit made. Please note that I will be making the final decision if I'm accepting
the addition or not.

## I have other ideas

Feel free to open an issue and/or PR so discussions. :)
